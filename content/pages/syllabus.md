Health care has been characterized as in crisis, or at least in need of addresses critical performance issues in the United States and globally. Seminar on Health Care Systems Innovation applies a systems perspective to understand health care delivery today, its stakeholders and problems as well as opportunities. Students will be introduced to the 'systems perspective' that has been used successfully in industries that include automobile manufacturing, air traffic control, telecommunications, utilities, etc., to address the introduction of new processes, technologies and strategies to improve overall health outcomes. This seminar will incorporate a multidisciplinary approach that will integrate medicine, social and behavioral sciences, operations research and management as well as engineering perspectives to stimulate new thinking in the practice, process and delivery of health care. Students are assigned to teams to work on a semester-long group project, in collaboration with staff of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston, MA. The project will incorporate insights gained from topics covered in class.
